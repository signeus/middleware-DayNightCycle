	- In the DayNightCycle script you have four variables.
		- Distance Sun (Is the position point max of your Sun. The default value is 500 if you not change it.)
		- Rotation Sun (Is the sun zenith angle)
		- Time Rotation (Is the movement of the Sun, if you check the "Real Time" is slow, otherwise if you "Real Time" is false this is fast.)
		- Real Time (The last variable, determine the realistic movement.)
